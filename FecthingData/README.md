# react_fetch


A few examples of handling data using React

## The ways to handle data in React

1. Autonomous -> Which the parent has no idea what the data is because the child component has fetch and stored it in state.

2. Higher Order -> The parent component has Fetch and stored the data and was passed the props to children

3. Render Props -> One Component does the fetching and uses another component that passes data as a child. 

4. Hooks -> Simular to Higher-Order components but not class based, but still pass the state in a simular way
